## Urban Stylist

The Urban Stylist website allows online users interested in today's fashion trends to be able to access the latest deals from websites across the web. 

Each of the items are placed in the Trending aisle, where users can add these to the virtual shopping cart from the Urban Stylists. The fundamentals behind this website are web scraping and data processing.

The front-end website is developed using Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, which are used to build the interface and animations of the site.
