## Personal Vault

Personal Vault is a password protected splash page that, once unlocked by password, reveals a web portal with a collection of Internet service, as well as a vault of personal information, news, and data that can be stored in the drive.

The backend uses cryptography to keep the data and items stored in the vault safe and secure. The specific encryption technique used is caused the RSA encryption algorithm, which obfuscates the data stored.

The weather forecast, most popular food spots, and things to do are just a few of the items to be stored securely in the Personal Vault.
