## LureLore

This project I developed won Hack the North 2024, Canada's Largest Hackathon. As the winner, our team was rewarded with many prestigious prizes from Amazon and AWS. But, winning this hackathon meant more to me than just the prizes and honor; it ignited my passion for innovation and building with creativity. Creativity is something that is unique about me.

Creativity. A word that has much meaning but so simplistic. To me, I am all about creativity; it is shown in my work and in my thought processes. 

This competitive achievement marks just one of my creative endeavours on my innovative journey. Anyways, here's what we built!

Caught a fish? Take a snap. Our AI-powered app identifies the catch, keeps track of stats, and puts that fish in your 3d, virtual, interactive aquarium! Simply click on any fish in your aquarium, and all its details — its rarity, location, and more — appear, bringing your fishing memories back to life. Also, depending on the fish you catch, reel in achievements, such as your first fish caught (ever!), or your first 20 incher. The cherry on top? All users’ catches are displayed on an interactive map (built with Leaflet), where you can discover new fishing spots, or plan to get your next big catch!

Our journey began with a simple observation: while fishing creates lasting memories, capturing those moments often falls short. We realized that a picture might be worth a thousand words, but a well-told fish tale is priceless. This spark ignited our mission to blend the age-old art of fishing with cutting-edge AI technology.

Diving into this project was like casting into uncharted waters – exhilarating and full of surprises. The tech stack used to build this innovative project are:

- Integrating AI models (Google's Gemini LLM) for image recognition and creative text generation
- Crafting seamless user experiences in React
- Building robust backend systems with Node.js and Express
- Managing data with MongoDB Atlas
- Creating immersive 3D environments using Three.js

But beyond the technical skills, we learned the art of transforming a simple idea into a full-fledged application that brings joy and preserves memories.
